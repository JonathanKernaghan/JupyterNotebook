# JupyterNotebook

As I create resources to supplement my PhD research in Deep Learning, I will be sharing them here in my JupyterNotebook repository.

The purpose of this is:

1) To backup the files
2) So that they are accessible from any device
3) So that I may share them with colleagues, academics or anyone who might find them useful
